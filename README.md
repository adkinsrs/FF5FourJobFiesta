# FF5FourJobFiesta
Script to assign Final Fantasy V classes, inspired by the Four Job Fiesta challenge run

The -r option allows you to choose your run type (from 'normal', 'random', 'chaos', 'classic', '750', and 'no750')
Please see the Four Job Fiesta site for run type descriptions (or read the Perl script comments)

The -n option allows you to make your run a 'natural' run meaning characters can only use the class assigned to them.

I'm thinking of writing this in multiple languages in order to practice in those languages
